# Booj Reading List
*Beware of the person of one book. -- Thomas Aquinas*
## Task
Compose a site using the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework that allows the user to create a list of books they would like to read. Users should be able to perform the following actions:
* Add or remove books from the list
* Change the order of the books in the list
* Sort the list of books by their author
* Display a book detail page with a minimum of author, publication date, and title

Please use the [ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/eloquent) rather than crafting queries by hand. 

##### Bonus points!

* Deploy it for real so we can play with it! (and then tell us about how you deployed it)
* Handle image uploading while adding books to the list
* Do something fancy like integrating an external API or handling user authentication
